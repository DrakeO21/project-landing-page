Project Landing Page

This project is based on mimicing a webpage through TOP without any given code 

Ive been given the template to a webpage and I will try to mimic it on my own with the skills that I have learned through the foundations curriculum in TOP

There will be one html file and one CSS file 

Im also new to commit messages but will try to really implement them into this project on my Github repo
